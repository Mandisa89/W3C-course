While my work in the camera department has given me incredible experiences and growth, I am excited to embark on this next chapter of my professional life, and applying those skills here..</p>

                <p>During the nationwide lockdown of 2020, I am helping to digitize hand-written lists for the distribution of food parcels in struggling communities.</p>
                <p>A plan-in-the-making is to contribute my passion for gardening to a local community garden inititiative, which aims to equip urban households with the tools and knowledge to grow their own backyard/rooftop farm. Currently, they are also increasing the bee habitat by installing hives in private gardens, under a honey-yield-share agreement. </p>
