            <h2>Leadership</h2>
            <p>
                I have dedicated the last nine years of my life to the Film Industry, which has engrained in me the importance of teamwork, chain-of-command and delegation, and accustomed me to working under high pressure, with high stakes, and adapting to perpetual last-minute changes of plan. While my work in the camera department has given me incredible experiences and growth, I am excited to embark on this next chapter of my professional life, and applying those skills here.

            <h2>Charity Work</h2>
            <p>During the nationwide lockdown of 2020, I am helping to digitize hand-written lists for the distribution of food parcels in struggling communities.</p>
            <p>A plan-in-the-making is to contribute my passion for gardening to a local community garden inititiative, which aims to equip urban households with the tools and knowledge to grow their own backyard/rooftop farm. Currently, they are also increasing the bee habitat by installing hives in private gardens, under a honey-yield-share agreement. </p>
