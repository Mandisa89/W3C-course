                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    Hello, I'm Mandisa. <br/>I am new to the world of web design and programming, but am so excited to be learning how to create tools and platforms for things I care about. <br/> I have dedicated the last nine years of my life to the Film Industry, which has engrained in me the importance of teamwork, and accustomed me to working under high pressure, with high stakes, and perpetual last-minute changes of plan. While my work in the camera department has given me incredible experiences and growth, I am excited to embark on this next chapter of my professional life, which will bring with it more day-to-day consistency and the potential of location-independence.<br/> In my spare time, I like to tend our new vegetable garden, tinker around on stringed instruments, do DIY projects and attend live music events.
